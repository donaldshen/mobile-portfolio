The completely-optimized project was built inside `./build`

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

- Used html tag like `async` and attribute `media` as many as I could. Check them in index.html. I added comments with 'promote:' above them.
- Used gulp to inline css, minify js/html/image files.

My `PageSpeed` score achieves at 96 for mobile.
